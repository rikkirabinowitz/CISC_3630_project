                                 <p>The guitar is a popular musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere
                                    from 4 to 18 strings, usually having 6. The sound is projected either acoustically or
                                    through electrical amplification. It is typically played by strumming or plucking the 
                                    strings with the right hand while pressing against the frets with the left hand. </p>
                                <p>
                                    The guitar is a type of chordophone and its sound is produced by way of a vibrating string 
                                    or strings stretched between two points. 
                                 
                                    The guitar is traditionally constructed from wood and it is strung with either gut, nylon
                                    or steel strings.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                               There is a debate among historians when the first guitar was invented but most agree that the
                                    original guitar was invented in Spain during the 16th century.
                                
                                </p>

                                <p>The 3 main types of guitars are categorized by either being Classical, Acoustic and 
                                    Electric. 
                                </p>
                                <p>A Classical guitar is strung by nylon strings and is used primarily as a solo instrument. 
                                    An Acoustic guitar is strung with steel strings and has more of a soulful acoustic feel 
                                    and sound.  The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings's vibration, 
                                    amplified by the body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber. 
                                
                                    Electric guitars were introduced in the 1930's and use an amplifier that can
                                    electronically manipulate and shape the tone. Electric guitars have had a continuing 
                                    profound influence on popular culture. </p>

                                    The guitar is used in a wide variety of musical genres worldwide. It is recognized as a 
                                    primary instrument in genres such as blues, bluegrass, country, flamenco, folk, jazz, 
                                    jota, mariachi, metal, punk, reggae, rock, soul, and many forms of pop.

                        guitarist to lower or raise the pitch of the string. The tuning pegs in the picture displayed are 
                        located on both sides of the head.

                    <p>All strings pass through a nut at the headstock end of the fretboard. Its function is to maintain correct string spacing and alignment so that the strings feed into their respective tuning pegs. On acoustic guitars the nut and saddle are usually made of the same material. Electric guitars commonly use plastic or synthetic nuts though sometimes metal is used.

Necks can be glued to the body (set neck) or bolted on. Set necks are usually found on acoustic guitars and many other instruments including the violin, lute and cello. The bolt-on neck is a design feature more commonly associated with electric guitars. Most necks are wood though alternative materials such as carbon fibre composites have been used.</p>

                    <p>The body of a guitar consists of a treble or upper bout and a bass or lower bout. The waist is the narrow section that divides them. The body is one of the most important factors in shaping the overall tone of a guitar. It provides the resonance that shapes the tonal qualities. It determines the volume of acoustic guitars and affects the sustain of electric guitars. The resonance is affected by:

    the types of wood used, whether the body is made from layered woods (ply) or single pieces, whether the body is hollow or solid and the shape and size of the body.

                    <p>Sound holes are found on all acoustics. Their purpose is to allow the air pressure to stay equalized so that the soundboard can vibrate. Archtop guitars have f-shaped sound holes - a design feature they share with the violin, viola, cello and double bass. Round sound holes usually have a decorated edge based on a geometrical design known as a rosette. On modern guitars these decorations are machine-made though some luthiers of expensive guitars still use the traditional method of laying by hand small pieces of exotic material like mother of pearl.</p>

                                        Learn the how to read a basic TAB. <br>When writing out guitar songs and chords, many artists use what we call "TABS".  </p>
                                    </header>
                            </div>
                            <div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
                                
The first thing you will notice about tabs is that there are six lines. 
                                <br>They represent the six strings of the guitar and typically look like this:
<br>

E|------------------------------------------------|<br>
B|------------------------------------------------|<br>
G|------------------------------------------------|<br>
D|------------------------------------------------|<br>
A|------------------------------------------------|<br>
E|------------------------------------------------|<br>


                                The letters on the left represent the name of each string. </p>
<p>
Note that the top string of your guitar (the 6th or E string) is written at the bottom of the tab, and the bottom string (1st of e string) is written at the top. Many beginners get confused at this, but this is the standard way to write tabs.

</p>

                          
                            </div>
                            <div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
                                <p>The next thing you notice on a tab is the numbers. The numbers represent frets. 1 means 1st fret, 2 means second fret and so on. A 0 (zero) means open string. <br>For example:
<br>

E|-------------2---------------------------------------|<br>
B|----------3-----3-----------------------------------|<br>
G|--------2-----------2-------------------------------|<br>
D|------0----------------------------------------------|<br>
A|------------------------------------------------------|<br>
E|------------------------------------------------------|<br>


Tabs are meant to be read from left to right. Here in this tab, first you play D string at open fret, then G string at 2nd Fret, then B string and 3rd fret and so on. If you know your chords, then you would notice that this tab plays the notes of a D major chord. </p>
